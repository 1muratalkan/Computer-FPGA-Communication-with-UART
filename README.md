# Computer-FPGA-Communication-with-UART

I debugged on a ZedBoard, facilitating communication between a signal generator and a computer application using UART communication. I performed tasks such as writing, reading, and other operations to the correct addresses.

My codes are not shared due to company confidentiality. You can access the image details of my project.
